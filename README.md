# Dark Mode ðŸŒ“
> PROD [Live] : https://dark-mode-react-project.netlify.app/

#### Dark Mode consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a
- Blog with a list of static text posts, navbar with a title *Overreacted* and a **Dark/Light toggle** button.
- Toggle button has the functionality to switch between the **light** and **dark** modes of the blog on click and its logic is handled by CSS.
- By default, the site is set to a light theme.
- **Local Storage** has been implemented to remember the mode of theme the user has been using. 
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
